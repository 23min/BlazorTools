# Introduction 
I tried to use various highlighting solutions in a Blazor Client app without success.  
BlazorTools provides a very lightweight component that formats and highlights code files. At the moment, only Json code is supported. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process  
Reference Proliminal.BlazorTools and add the component to your Blazor page:

`<Proliminal.BlazorTools.Editor Code=@forecasts></Proliminal.BlazorTools.Editor>`

2.	Software dependencies

None.

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
I've not planned anything long-term for this. I'm just serving an immediate need. It's possible that I will add support for other languages (XML first), unless I find another lightweight solution that works inside Blazor Client side pages.

That said, contributions are welcome.
